- 👋 Hi, I’m @BlakeK9 from Sydney, Australia
- 👀 I’m interested in finding ways to automate some of my work and the work of others
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use this website, trying to learn VBA for excel, and trying to learn google sheets scripts
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that takes my fancy, but probably focused on things that will help me practice/learn managing databases, creating user access forms and tracking/logging user changes, and automated reports & reminders from the data
- 📫 How to reach me probably best would be email, being blakesriver at gmail
